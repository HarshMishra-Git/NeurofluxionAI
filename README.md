# Neurofluxion AI - Orchestrating Intelligence

A comprehensive multi-agent AI assistant system built with FastAPI, LangChain, LangGraph, and a modern React frontend. Features a local-first architecture with voice, vision, and text capabilities, and is designed for privacy, extensibility, and offline use.

## üß© Problem Statement

Modern AI assistants often depend on cloud services, risking user privacy and limiting customization. There is a need for a modular, local-first AI system that supports advanced multi-modal interactions (text, voice, vision) and can be easily extended or adapted for specific domains‚Äîall while maintaining user data confidentiality and supporting offline operation.

---

## üí° Solution Overview

**Neurofluxion AI** addresses these challenges by orchestrating a suite of specialized agents using local models and a unified orchestration backend. The system supports:

- Multi-agent workflows for semantic search, summarization, vision, voice, and more.
- End-to-end local deployment (no cloud required) for privacy and speed.
- Easy customization for new domains (e.g., healthcare, e-commerce) by ingesting new data and updating agent logic.
- Modern, responsive UI with support for text, voice, and image inputs plus real-time agent monitoring.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Modular LangChain agents with specialized capabilities (semantic search, summarization, vision, TTS, etc.)
- **Local-First Design:** Works entirely with local models (Ollama for LLM, Whisper for speech, ChromaDB for vector search)
- **Voice Capabilities:** Speech-to-text (Whisper) and text-to-speech (TTS) processing
- **Vision Processing:** Image analysis and OCR capabilities
- **Semantic Search:** ChromaDB-powered vector search with domain-adaptable embeddings
- **Dual Theme UI:** Professional light/dark mode interface
- **Real-Time Status:** Live agent monitoring and system metrics
- **Dockerized Deployment:** One-command startup for the entire stack

### **Component Overview**

- **Frontend (React + Vite):**
  - Modern UI for chat, voice, and vision interactions
  - Real-time agent status and dual theme support
- **Backend (FastAPI):**
  - Orchestrates agent workflow and handles API requests
  - Manages user queries, agent routing, and post-processing
- **LangChain Agents:**
  - **Semantic Search:** Retrieves relevant documents using embeddings and ChromaDB
  - **Summarizer:** Summarizes long responses or documents
  - **Vision:** Handles image analysis and OCR
  - **TTS:** Converts text responses to speech
- **Ollama:**
  - Local LLM for all language generation and intent analysis
- **Whisper:**
  - Local speech-to-text for voice input
- **ChromaDB:**
  - Vector database for storing and searching document embeddings
